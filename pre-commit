# This script is a wrapper around the run-tests.sh script.
# It is highly recommended to link it as the git pre-commit hook via:

# ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

# The difference to the run-tests.sh script is that this script stashes
# unstaged changes before testing (see below). Thus only the changeset to be
# commited will be tested. No worries, "git commit -a" will still work ;)

# Stash unstaged changes if and only if possible:
# Its important to skip the stashing if there are no changes detected!
# Otherwise 'git stash -q --keep-index' will not create a stash.
# Later 'git stash apply --index -q' would then unintentionally apply
# an older stash.

if git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    # this happens for example on git commit --amend
    echo "No changes detected. Skipping tests..."
    sleep 1
    exitcode=0
elif [ -e .git/MERGE_HEAD ]; then
    echo "Merge in progress... Testing against the working directory leaving unstages changes intact!"
    ./run-tests.sh
    exitcode=$?
else
    git stash -q --keep-index
    ./run-tests.sh
    exitcode=$?
    git reset --hard -q && git stash apply --index -q && git stash drop -q
